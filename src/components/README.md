## Components Folder

In real-world projects, we must put all the shared components here. Such as UI components, form elements, etc. Due the lack of time, I have not compnonentized as atomic as possible. However, this folder is meant to be the place of all the as small as atom components. Like buttons, inputs, checkboxes, avatars and so on.
